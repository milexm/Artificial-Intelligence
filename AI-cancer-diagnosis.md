> Patients or caregivers interested in participation should explore platforms
> like **ClinicalTrials.gov** or contact these institutions directly to
> understand eligibility and availability.

## 2. Steps to find a clinical trial

1. **Gather Details About Your Cancer**. Collect information about your diagnosis, including the type and stage of cancer, treatments you've received, and any genetic mutations.

1. **Find Clinical Trials**. Use resources like 
[ClinicalTrials.gov](ClinicalTrials.gov) to search for trials that match your criteria. You can also contact organizations like the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for assistance.

1. **Take a Closer Look**. Review the eligibility criteria and study details to ensure the trial is a good fit for you.

1. **Contact the Research Team**. Reach out to the team running the trial to ask questions and express your interest.

1. **Ask Questions**. Discuss the trial with your healthcare provider and ask about potential risks and benefits.

1. **Make an Appointment**. If everything aligns, schedule an appointment to participate in the trial.

### 2.1. Resources

1. [ClinicalTrials.gov](ClinicalTrials.gov). A searchable database of clinical trials worldwide.

1. **National Cancer Institute** (NCI). Offers a six-step guide to finding clinical trials and provides a tailored search service.

1. **NIH Clinical Research Trials and You**. Information on how to find and participate in NIH-sponsored trials.
