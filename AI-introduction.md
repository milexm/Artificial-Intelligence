## 1. Topics

### 1.1. Definition and scope of Artificial Intelligence

AI is a branch of computer science focused on building systems capable of
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 

These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving problems.

#### 1.1.1. Scope of AI

- **Narrow AI** (specialized systems). AI designed to perform a specific task, such as virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa) or recommendation engines (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).

- **General AI** (theoretical concept). AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do, with reasoning and understanding across multiple domains.

- **Key fields within AI**. Machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems.

#### 1.1.2. Example applications

- Healthcare. AI-powered diagnostic tools.
- Automotive. Self-driving cars.
- Daily life. Smart home devices.

#### 1.1.3. Key characteristics of AI systems

- Perception: The ability of AI systems to interpret and process sensory data. For example:
- Vision: Detecting objects in images using computer vision algorithms
- Speech: Converting spoken language into text using speech recognition technologies.
- Reasoning: The ability to infer conclusions and make logical decisions based on data and rules. For example:
  - Deductive reasoning: Using existing knowledge to draw specific conclusions (e.g., expert systems diagnosing diseases).
  - Inductive reasoning: Learning patterns from data and generalizing
- Decision-Making: The capacity to choose the best course of action among various alternatives. For example:
  - Autonomous systems like drones or self-driving cars deciding optimal navigation paths.
  - Recommendation systems suggesting products or content based on user preferences.

- Learning: The ability to improve performance over time through experience. Examples include machine learning algorithms that refine predictions as more data becomes available.

## 2. Activities

### 2.1. Introduction to ChatGPT

ChatGPT stands for **Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer**.

- **Chat**. Refers to its conversational abilities, designed to engage in natural language dialogue with users.
- **Generative**. Highlights its capability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses based on input.
- **Pre-trained**. Indicates that the model is trained on large datasets beforehand, enabling it to understand and respond effectively.
- **Transformer**. Refers to the architecture underlying the model, which uses a mechanism of attention to understand and generate text. This is part of the transformer neural network framework introduced in the groundbreaking paper **Attention Is All You Need** (2017).

The following image visually explains the components of ChatGPT, emphasizing the relationships among its parts: "Chat," "Generative," "Pre-trained," and "Transformer."

Each concept is represented with a descriptive label and icon to
enhance understanding.

ChatGPT is part of OpenAI's family of large language models (LLMs) and showcases advancements in AI-driven communication and reasoning.


#### 2.1.1. ChatGPT’s interface and capabilities

##### 2.1.1.1. Interface Overview

ChatGPT provides a user-friendly interface where users can type prompts into a text box and receive AI-generated responses in real time.

Features include:

- Text input field for entering queries or instructions.
- Chat history that retains a conversation context for a session.
- Optional features like exporting chats or providing feedback on responses.

##### 2.1.1.2. Capabilities

- **Conversational Assistance**. Responds to questions, provides explanations, and generates ideas for various topics.
  - Example: "Explain the basics of neural networks in simple terms."

- **Content Generation**. Drafts essays, articles, emails, and code snippets.
  - Example: "Write an email inviting a guest speaker to our AI workshop."

- **Programming Assistance**. Debugs code, explains algorithms, and writes scripts.
  - Example: "Fix this Python code snippet for loading a dataset."

- **Brainstorming**. Generates creative ideas, such as project proposals or story concepts.
  - Example: "Suggest three innovative applications for AI in education."

- **Learning and summarize**. Summarizes articles, simplifies complex topics, and provides study guides.
  - Example: "Summarize the key points from an article on reinforcement learning."

- **Tips for Effective Use**.

  - **Be specific with prompts**. Clearly describe the task or question
  - **Experiment with rephrasing**. Try different ways to ask a question for improved responses.
  - **Provide context**. If working on a multi-step task, remind ChatGPT of earlier steps.

##### 2.1.1.3. Limitations

- ChatGPT does not access live internet data and is limited to its training knowledge.
- Responses might not always be accurate or contextually perfect.
- It relies on user input for maintaining context in complex discussions.


#### 2.1.2. Examples of using ChatGPT

- Generate a summary of a recent AI milestone, such as OpenAI's GPT advancements.

- Answer basic questions about AI history and applications.

### 2.2. Hands-on exercise

- Research activity: Each student will find and summarize a real-world AI application using ChatGPT.

- Example prompt for ChatGPT: "Summarize how AI is used in healthcare for disease diagnosis."
