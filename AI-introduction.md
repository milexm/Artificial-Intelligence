## 1. Topics

### 1.1. Definition and scope of Artificial Intelligence

AI is a branch of computer science focused on building systems capable of
performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 

These tasks include understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and solving problems.

#### 1.1.1. Scope of AI

- **Narrow AI** (specialized systems). AI designed to perform a specific task, such as virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa) or recommendation engines (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).

- **General AI** (theoretical concept). AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do, with reasoning and understanding across multiple domains.

- **Key fields within AI**. Machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems.

#### 1.1.2. Example applications

- Healthcare. AI-powered diagnostic tools.
- Automotive. Self-driving cars.
- Daily life. Smart home devices.

#### 1.1.3. Key characteristics of AI systems

- Perception: The ability of AI systems to interpret and process sensory data. For example:
- Vision: Detecting objects in images using computer vision algorithms
- Speech: Converting spoken language into text using speech recognition technologies.
- Reasoning: The ability to infer conclusions and make logical decisions based on data and rules. For example:
  - Deductive reasoning: Using existing knowledge to draw specific conclusions (e.g., expert systems diagnosing diseases).
  - Inductive reasoning: Learning patterns from data and generalizing
- Decision-Making: The capacity to choose the best course of action among various alternatives. For example:
  - Autonomous systems like drones or self-driving cars deciding optimal navigation paths.
  - Recommendation systems suggesting products or content based on user preferences.

- Learning: The ability to improve performance over time through experience. Examples include machine learning algorithms that refine predictions as more data becomes available.

## 2. Activities
