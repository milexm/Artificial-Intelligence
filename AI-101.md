This section contains step‐by‐step “AI 101” guide—complete with Python examples and explanations—to help you build a strong foundation before advancing to more complex topics (AI 102/103).

- [1. Install Required Packages](#1-install-required-packages)
- [2. Get Familiar with Python for Data and AI](#2-get-familiar-with-python-for-data-and-ai)


## 1. Install Required Packages

Install libraries you’ll need (for data manipulation, visualization, and AI integration):

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib openai flask

## 2. Get Familiar with Python for Data and AI

See the example [code-samples\python-data-analysis.py](code-samples\python-data-analysis.py).

1. **Working with Arrays using NumPy**. NumPy provides fast array operations that are the backbone of many AI libraries. 
1. **Manipulating Data with Pandas**. Pandas is great for loading, cleaning, and analyzing data. 
1. **Visualizing Data with Matplotlib**. Matplotlib helps you create plots and visualize data insights.
